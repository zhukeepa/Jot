# Jot

https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jot/dhofiojklfehbkladjlmfljpifchcpbg

Chrome extension for taking quick notes unobtrusively. Opens a textbox in the corner of your browser which you can start typing into immediately, and which focuses you back to whatever you were doing before after you close it. Highly recommended to set up a [keyboard shortcut](http://lifehacker.com/add-custom-keyboard-shortcuts-to-chrome-extensions-for-1595322121) for opening+closing it.

You can use Ctrl+Enter to email yourself the contents of the textbox. Set your email in the options page (right-click the Jot icon and select "Options"). 

Note: all your emails get sent through jot.mailer@gmail.com, a Gmail account I own. I run scheduled scripts to clear all sent messages and never actually sign into the account myself, but I would still caution against using this extension for sensitive information. Email sent through a [Rails server on Heroku](http://jot-mailer.herokuapp.com), source code [here](http://github.com/zhukeepa/jot-mailer).
